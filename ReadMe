Proteus is a Virtual System Modelling and circuit simulation application. The suite combines mixed mode SPICE circuit simulation, animated components and microprocessor models to facilitate co-simulation of complete microcontroller based designs. Proteus also has the ability to simulate the interaction between software running on a microcontroller and any analog or digital electronics connected to it. It simulates Input / Output ports, interrupts, timers, USARTs and all other peripherals present on each supported processor.

This is not the full Proteus software, it is a demo version. The Limitations of the demonstration version are as follows:
- You cannot print any Schematics, Bill of Materials or Layouts.
- You cannot save your work.
- You cannot simulate your own microcontroller designs.

You can however write your own software programs to run on the existing sample design suite for evaluation purposes. It is not time limited!
Proteus is a free trial software application from the Math & Scientific Tools subcategory, part of the Business category. The app is currently available in English and it was last updated on 2017-02-28. The program can be installed on win.
